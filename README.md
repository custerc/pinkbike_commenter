# What the hell is this?

[@ExcitedPinkbike](https://twitter.com/ExcitedPinkbike) is a Twitter account that posts AI-generated Pinkbike comments. It posts a few each day, sometimes. Sometimes it doesn't post. (It's probably out riding).

## ...what?

Basically, I got tens of thousands of comments from Pinkbike articles over the past couple of years.

I then filtered those comments using VADER sentiment analysis to select "high emotion" comments (comments with a VADER compound score above 0.5 or below -0.5).

I used these comments to train a text-generating "AI" called GPT-2. It's not really intelligent, and it doesn't know anything about bikes -- what it does is read through all the thousands of Pinkbike comments I fed it, and "learn" what Pinkbike comments are like.

It then tries to replicate them, with sometimes humorous effect. That's what you see in the Twitter account.

## So a computer wrote these tweets?

Yes... kind of. GPT-2 generated all of the tweets you see, but I (a human named Charlie) have done two things:

1. Selected specific comments from the many GPT-2 created that I think are particularly amusing, insane, absurd, or representative of Pinkbike commenters.
2. In some cases, made very slight edits to the messages. I don't write anything, but I might (for example) select only part of a comment GPT-2 has generated to make it fit into a tweet.

## ...why? Why would you do this?

They made some offhand reference to this on the Pinkbike podcast and the idea got stuck in my head.

I thought it would be an interesting learning experience.

However, I will concede that this is objectively terrible and no one should ever have done this.
