I’ve been riding my used 2017 trail bike since summer and it’s barely functional. It’s built to last.,101
The whole world is watching you and some of you guys are being some shits and need to shut the fuck up.,103
"Regarding the nuts and bolts for the shock, they are all pretty simple. You can get a dropper for it in a few places, but you need to remember to put a battery in it.",166
Your riding is so much better than yours.,41
"@Muckal: Voted for you. I absolutely loved your work, but feel like I should have voted for you too. These days I'm like: """"Where's my vote?"""" You know how it is.",162
"@mikelevy: It's a shame because the Horizons Haster is a pretty cool bike for the price, but when it came out I was in for the shock fork. I had a set of Horizons forks on a few different bikes and was disappointed.",215
"No one is making a difference to the way bikes are ridden, except for people who need to be reminded that a bike is a bike.",123
I have a few comments about sick bikes. The clever folks at Offering have a great product. I'm in the market for a new bike. A new bike that sounds like it could be a sick one.,176
"If you want to be a good mechanic, you need to have a business. At best you can keep your business, and at worst you can't.",123
"In most cases, the more expensive the bike the more likely it is to fail.",73
"I have a suggestion for you: To get rid of the expensive, well-known, and on-line components of MTB, you can replace the bar, grips, grips and grips with a much more modern, modern, reliable spec.",196
"@brianpark: I know the guys at Pinkbike aren't in charge of your site / product/etc, but it sure seems like they're trying to get users to buy a product that isn't a """"websites"""" or """"a bulletin board"""" lol",206
"I'm a big fan of the freestylers, but I always have to wonder how the extra length of the trail is going to fit on the bike.",124
"I hate the fact the whole bike is like a second hand pile of garbage, it's the World Cup bike that was designed to be garbage.",126
I love the concept of an XC bike. I'm a tall and lean guy with a muscular build as well as a long legs. I'm not a big guy. I like to do it the way it's done. There are a few specific things I'd like to try though.,213
"I have a question for you. In other words, where the hell is the enduro season?",79
"""I hate the stink of a burrito!"" @rrolly: I'm not talking about the burrito. I'm talking about the fork.",104
I hate what I see.  Can't stand the concept of a 30 pound bike with a motor.,76
"I have the new GX, GX2, GX3, GX4, GX5, and GX6. Bike reviews are a lot more relevant now.",89
You're a redneck.  You have a shitty job.  You have a shitty family.  You have a shitty job.  You have a shitty job.  You have a shitty family.  You have a shitty job.  You have a shitty job.  You have,201
I hate the fact that you are riding an enduro bike that has just a single pivot and no chainstays.,98
"Comparing Fox and RockShox, I'd say the only real difference is that RockShox has a higher end graphics card.",109
"The best bike at $160 is a GoPro. I'm only slightly disappointed in the Rocky Mountain of the Ibis lineup. I have to admit, the Garmin is a great value; both the Garmin and the Garmin-XT are sky high.",200
"Looks like a hardtail. I think a lot of people are into the concept of a 200+ lb super light, but I'm not sure there are many people who are that into the idea of a frame with a 150-150 mm suspension and a 130-140 mm fork.",222
The only way to do better in a race is to run some speed wheels on your back.,77
I have a set of GX pedals that I cant find anywhere.,52
I am not going to bash the high altitude jumpers flat but there's no reason to be irresponsible and go out of your way to test ride trails.,139
I am embarrassed to say I am a little crazy. I had the same experience with myself having a few drinks at the trailhead. ,121
"I like the way he has this mental element to him. He is a true trail builder, he's got the attitude and the humility, the confidence and the determination to be the best. I'd say he's a good genetic kid, he loves the sport and loves the sport. ",244
I’ve been riding for over 100 years and still have my first MTB.,64
"When jumping, be sure to hold the top of the tube and let the air flow in, and ALSO the top tube should be in contact with the ground.",134
"I've raced a lot of the lower end trails and had a few crashes in the past that I'd like to share with you. I'm sure I'd like to run a bike a bit better, but I'm not sure that's worth the extra time.",199
"I've raced a lot of XC events and have won about twice as many XC events as any other rider. And yes, that's a good way to get some sleep.",138
"Haha, I’ve been following the trend for a while and now I've been buying more stuff. And I’m still pretty bummed about buying expensive stuff, because I’ve been buying more stuff for the last few years. It’s just like when I started, but it’s more expensive.",258
I am a 2/3 year old that likes rides. I have a 2.5 year old “Stumpy” and it’s such a fun ride. It’s such a lot of fun to ride and just a little bit more fun to ride. I can ride around town and ride trails and go to the gym.,223
"""As a California native, I think all California people should be able to get a beer and a pizza."" ""@jlawysports: I'm not sure about the pizza, but I do agree with your comment.",176
"The best bike for the money is a modern, modern, modern, modern, modern bike. I have a 50 year old DHR out of the box. It has been perfect all my life.",151
"I'm sure there are plenty of riders who can appear on the homepage and tell me I'm a stupid f*cking idiot for having the wrong idea. I'm not arguing that they should make the bike and make it a hardtail, just that they should make it a hardtail.",245
The best bike for the job is the one that makes you feel good about yourself. Good luck and keep climbing.,106
I only ride and ride. I don't want to be a dick about it.,57
"Oil slick. I think it's a good idea, but I'm not convinced it's worth it for the price.",87
The biggest mistake with bikes is that it doesn't even matter what the bike is. It's all about the riding. Riding it is the one thing you don't want.,149
Danny Macaskill was on the podium in a few seconds. I'll say more clearly: the slight heave-hooing that made that podium sound like a top-notch performance. He will be back in 2017. ,182
"""Danny Macaskill is a pro, but he is a guy who is more like the guy in the video, but he is also a pro pro. I'm sure there will be discussion on this, as well."" @pigman: I am not sure what the hell you're talking about.",219
"Bikes and politics. One side has the military, the other side has the fat rich.",79
"It’s funny, I’d rather buy a new bike while I still have a good pair of shoes. I’ll be buying shoes while I’m old.",114
Smashy is a great bike. But he’s a bit of a dick in a bunch of ways. I’m sure he’s not the same person. But that’s not the point.,129
"flat pedals are so much fun when you're on a hardtail but not when you're on a dh bike. I'm not a racer so I'm not sure. To begin with, I think it's good to have the ability to choose the pedals you'd like and then have a couple of weeks to plan your ride.",256
"Shit, I got in a fight with my training, I ended up doing really, really bad training, and got a full suspension bike in the same year. It was a pretty stupid bike.",164
Pinkbike commenters will still be angry if you don't show up on Pinkbike to call me a f*cking idiot.,100
"Pinkbike commenters, please stop calling me a douche.",53
"Pinkbike commenters will be shuttling me to every set of trails I ride. I'm not like the trolls, I'm not like the pot-heads, I'm like the drunk-ass social media types.",167
"Pinkbike commenters like to point out that PB is on the same team as the real estate companies who are in charge of the land. So, for example, the PB staff is on board with you that Google can show up your site with the title as Homeownership",242
I'm like a flaming ass for not buying a bike.,45
"Pinkbike commenters, can you guys let me know that you're going to be there for a few days? I'm sure you can figure out a way to get off my lawn.",145
"Pinkbike commenters, those stinking shells, those slow hands, those hands... I really don't get it. I saw a few videos of the Crankbrothers last year in the PNW, and I love how they're all still alive.",201
"I'm not a big fan of the idea of bigger bikes, but I'm not going to pretend that I'm a big fan of the idea of smaller bikes.",124
I was at the bike park and I'm still wearing a full suspension race bike.,73
Friday fails videos: It would be nice if all the riders were strong enough to hit the epic gaps,95
"It's important to note that I'm not a professional cyclist, but you can help me figure out whether I'm a professional cyclist, so here's my answer: yes.  It's not hard.",168
"I remember when I was in high school, all the bikes were so damn expensive that I had to make do with my own money. I ended up building a bike shop",147
The PB community is not at all prepared for this. I will be a PB Commentator for a little while until the time I am really ready to take over the world and start to approve comments.,182
"PB commenters are supposedly racist. I'm not sure if it's just me, but I have no idea. I wish they would make some diversity in the comments, but I don't think it's going to happen.",181
"Levy's fastest time in 2020 was 2.4 seconds, so I think it is safe to say that he is the fastest man in the world. I feel that he too has a lot of talent, but he is a lot slower than most of us.",194
Levy's list says he's done a lot of trash work in the past and that maybe he can be a good example for future generations.,122
"The bike looks great, will be nice to have two wheels. I'd be interested in buying one.",87
"Kaz: his real name is Sam Kazimer, and he is the first person to confirm that. He is a guy who's been with the same company for over a decade now, and he's all over the place.",175
The most annoying thing about Internet is that you have no idea what kind of stuff you are talking about.,105
The most annoying part of upgrading to a new bike is that you have to replace the frame every time you go to the shop for a frame replacement.,142
The most annoying part is that you have to take the pedal arse off the pedal.,77
"Crashing a bike into a rock garden is dangerous. I like seeing my bike bounce a bit off the rock, but it's never going to be like that.",135
Crashing is a great way to build confidence and a good way to build confidence and confidence as you race. I beat myself up trying to do this last year,151
"Crashing with your hands or feet is stupid. Period. If you can't handle it, it's probably because you're concerned for your own well-being. This is a very similar situation as when you have a broken collar bone and you're worried for your own well-being.",254
"Hardtails are the most expensive bikes ever built, the last one would've been $200,000. The other bikes are all over the place and they are all pretty much the same price.",171
I've been riding around in the woods with a friend a few weeks now and he's had a couple of crashes (presumably as a result of the wheel being on the ground),157
I'm not complaining about the trails. I'm complaining about the people who ride them. I'm trying to find out how they're able to go so far.,139
"I would have preferred a third wheel with a 5.8"" diameter. I am 3’4” and have smaller wheels, so the sizing is fine for me.",123
If I was riding in Canada I would be wearing a beard.,53
