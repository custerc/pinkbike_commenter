I’ve been riding my used 2017 trail bike since summer and it’s barely functional. It’s built to last.,101
The whole world is watching you and some of you guys are being some shits and need to shut the fuck up.,103
"Regarding the nuts and bolts for the shock, they are all pretty simple. You can get a dropper for it in a few places, but you need to remember to put a battery in it.",166
Your riding is so much better than yours.,41
"@Muckal: Voted for you. I absolutely loved your work, but feel like I should have voted for you too. These days I'm like: """"Where's my vote?"""" You know how it is.",162
"@mikelevy: It's a shame because the Horizons Haster is a pretty cool bike for the price, but when it came out I was in for the shock fork. I had a set of Horizons forks on a few different bikes and was disappointed.",215
"No one is making a difference to the way bikes are ridden, except for people who need to be reminded that a bike is a bike.",123
I have a few comments about sick bikes. The clever folks at Offering have a great product. I'm in the market for a new bike. A new bike that sounds like it could be a sick one.,176
"If you want to be a good mechanic, you need to have a business. At best you can keep your business, and at worst you can't.",123
"In most cases, the more expensive the bike the more likely it is to fail.",73
"I have a suggestion for you: To get rid of the expensive, well-known, and on-line components of MTB, you can replace the bar, grips, grips and grips with a much more modern, modern, reliable spec.",196
"@brianpark: I know the guys at Pinkbike aren't in charge of your site / product/etc, but it sure seems like they're trying to get users to buy a product that isn't a """"websites"""" or """"a bulletin board"""" lol",206
"I'm a big fan of the freestylers, but I always have to wonder how the extra length of the trail is going to fit on the bike.",124
"I hate the fact the whole bike is like a second hand pile of garbage, it's the World Cup bike that was designed to be garbage.",126
I love the concept of an XC bike. I'm a tall and lean guy with a muscular build as well as a long legs. I'm not a big guy. I like to do it the way it's done. There are a few specific things I'd like to try though.,213
"I have a question for you. In other words, where the hell is the enduro season?",79
"""I hate the stink of a burrito!"" @rrolly: I'm not talking about the burrito. I'm talking about the fork.",104
I hate what I see.  Can't stand the concept of a 30 pound bike with a motor.,76
"I have the new GX, GX2, GX3, GX4, GX5, and GX6. Bike reviews are a lot more relevant now.",89
You're a redneck.  You have a shitty job.  You have a shitty family.  You have a shitty job.  You have a shitty job.  You have a shitty family.  You have a shitty job.  You have a shitty job.  You have,201
I hate the fact that you are riding an enduro bike that has just a single pivot and no chainstays.,98
"Comparing Fox and RockShox, I'd say the only real difference is that RockShox has a higher end graphics card.",109
"The best bike at $160 is a GoPro. I'm only slightly disappointed in the Rocky Mountain of the Ibis lineup. I have to admit, the Garmin is a great value; both the Garmin and the Garmin-XT are sky high.",200
"Looks like a hardtail. I think a lot of people are into the concept of a 200+ lb super light, but I'm not sure there are many people who are that into the idea of a frame with a 150-150 mm suspension and a 130-140 mm fork.",222
The only way to do better in a race is to run some speed wheels on your back.,77
I have a set of GX pedals that I cant find anywhere.,52
I am not going to bash the high altitude jumpers flat but there's no reason to be irresponsible and go out of your way to test ride trails.,139
I am embarrassed to say I am a little crazy. I had the same experience with myself having a few drinks at the trailhead. ,121
"I like the way he has this mental element to him. He is a true trail builder, he's got the attitude and the humility, the confidence and the determination to be the best. I'd say he's a good genetic kid, he loves the sport and loves the sport. ",244
I’ve been riding for over 100 years and still have my first MTB.,64
"When jumping, be sure to hold the top of the tube and let the air flow in, and ALSO the top tube should be in contact with the ground.",134
"I've raced a lot of the lower end trails and had a few crashes in the past that I'd like to share with you. I'm sure I'd like to run a bike a bit better, but I'm not sure that's worth the extra time.",199
"I've raced a lot of XC events and have won about twice as many XC events as any other rider. And yes, that's a good way to get some sleep.",138
"Haha, I’ve been following the trend for a while and now I've been buying more stuff. And I’m still pretty bummed about buying expensive stuff, because I’ve been buying more stuff for the last few years. It’s just like when I started, but it’s more expensive.",258
I am a 2/3 year old that likes rides. I have a 2.5 year old “Stumpy” and it’s such a fun ride. It’s such a lot of fun to ride and just a little bit more fun to ride. I can ride around town and ride trails and go to the gym.,223
"""As a California native, I think all California people should be able to get a beer and a pizza."" ""@jlawysports: I'm not sure about the pizza, but I do agree with your comment.",176
"The best bike for the money is a modern, modern, modern, modern, modern bike. I have a 50 year old DHR out of the box. It has been perfect all my life.",151
"I'm sure there are plenty of riders who can appear on the homepage and tell me I'm a stupid f*cking idiot for having the wrong idea. I'm not arguing that they should make the bike and make it a hardtail, just that they should make it a hardtail.",245
The best bike for the job is the one that makes you feel good about yourself. Good luck and keep climbing.,106
I only ride and ride. I don't want to be a dick about it.,57
"Oil slick. I think it's a good idea, but I'm not convinced it's worth it for the price.",87
The biggest mistake with bikes is that it doesn't even matter what the bike is. It's all about the riding. Riding it is the one thing you don't want.,149
Danny Macaskill was on the podium in a few seconds. I'll say more clearly: the slight heave-hooing that made that podium sound like a top-notch performance. He will be back in 2017. ,182
"""Danny Macaskill is a pro, but he is a guy who is more like the guy in the video, but he is also a pro pro. I'm sure there will be discussion on this, as well."" @pigman: I am not sure what the hell you're talking about.",219
"Bikes and politics. One side has the military, the other side has the fat rich.",79
"It’s funny, I’d rather buy a new bike while I still have a good pair of shoes. I’ll be buying shoes while I’m old.",114
Smashy is a great bike. But he’s a bit of a dick in a bunch of ways. I’m sure he’s not the same person. But that’s not the point.,129
"flat pedals are so much fun when you're on a hardtail but not when you're on a dh bike. I'm not a racer so I'm not sure. To begin with, I think it's good to have the ability to choose the pedals you'd like and then have a couple of weeks to plan your ride.",256
"Shit, I got in a fight with my training, I ended up doing really, really bad training, and got a full suspension bike in the same year. It was a pretty stupid bike.",164
Pinkbike commenters will still be angry if you don't show up on Pinkbike to call me a f*cking idiot.,100
"Pinkbike commenters, please stop calling me a douche.",53
"Pinkbike commenters will be shuttling me to every set of trails I ride. I'm not like the trolls, I'm not like the pot-heads, I'm like the drunk-ass social media types.",167
"Pinkbike commenters like to point out that PB is on the same team as the real estate companies who are in charge of the land. So, for example, the PB staff is on board with you that Google can show up your site with the title as Homeownership",242
I'm like a flaming ass for not buying a bike.,45
"Pinkbike commenters, can you guys let me know that you're going to be there for a few days? I'm sure you can figure out a way to get off my lawn.",145
"Pinkbike commenters, those stinking shells, those slow hands, those hands... I really don't get it. I saw a few videos of the Crankbrothers last year in the PNW, and I love how they're all still alive.",201
"I'm not a big fan of the idea of bigger bikes, but I'm not going to pretend that I'm a big fan of the idea of smaller bikes.",124
I was at the bike park and I'm still wearing a full suspension race bike.,73
Friday fails videos: It would be nice if all the riders were strong enough to hit the epic gaps,95
"It's important to note that I'm not a professional cyclist, but you can help me figure out whether I'm a professional cyclist, so here's my answer: yes.  It's not hard.",168
"I remember when I was in high school, all the bikes were so damn expensive that I had to make do with my own money. I ended up building a bike shop",147
The PB community is not at all prepared for this. I will be a PB Commentator for a little while until the time I am really ready to take over the world and start to approve comments.,182
"PB commenters are supposedly racist. I'm not sure if it's just me, but I have no idea. I wish they would make some diversity in the comments, but I don't think it's going to happen.",181
"Levy's fastest time in 2020 was 2.4 seconds, so I think it is safe to say that he is the fastest man in the world. I feel that he too has a lot of talent, but he is a lot slower than most of us.",194
Levy's list says he's done a lot of trash work in the past and that maybe he can be a good example for future generations.,122
"The bike looks great, will be nice to have two wheels. I'd be interested in buying one.",87
"Kaz: his real name is Sam Kazimer, and he is the first person to confirm that. He is a guy who's been with the same company for over a decade now, and he's all over the place.",175
The most annoying thing about Internet is that you have no idea what kind of stuff you are talking about.,105
The most annoying part of upgrading to a new bike is that you have to replace the frame every time you go to the shop for a frame replacement.,142
The most annoying part is that you have to take the pedal arse off the pedal.,77
"Crashing a bike into a rock garden is dangerous. I like seeing my bike bounce a bit off the rock, but it's never going to be like that.",135
Crashing is a great way to build confidence and a good way to build confidence and confidence as you race. I beat myself up trying to do this last year,151
"Crashing with your hands or feet is stupid. Period. If you can't handle it, it's probably because you're concerned for your own well-being. This is a very similar situation as when you have a broken collar bone and you're worried for your own well-being.",254
"Hardtails are the most expensive bikes ever built, the last one would've been $200,000. The other bikes are all over the place and they are all pretty much the same price.",171
I've been riding around in the woods with a friend a few weeks now and he's had a couple of crashes (presumably as a result of the wheel being on the ground),157
I'm not complaining about the trails. I'm complaining about the people who ride them. I'm trying to find out how they're able to go so far.,139
"I would have preferred a third wheel with a 5.8"" diameter. I am 3’4” and have smaller wheels, so the sizing is fine for me.",123
If I was riding in Canada I would be wearing a beard.,53
I'm pretty sure the guys on the roadie trail don't need to be in a competition.,79
The best way to learn is to win your first race. You'll get into ride mode a lot faster.,88
"The worst thing is that the frame is a shitty-built. I'm not ripping anything, but I'm seeing so many other people's frames and bikes with shitty frames with terrible little and tiny pieces of a frame that are just horrible.",224
Pinkbike is one of my fav bikes and it is also one of the most fun bikes I own. I also ride a lot of trails and have a lot of fun with my 3-5 year old XC bike.,159
inkbike has too many people and so many products to pick. They are nothing like a bike shop.,92
@mikelevy: I've got a bike for $10.,35
"Pinkbike commenters are so trash in their comments, that I don't even understand what they are saying.",102
"It's a great feeling to be able to go out and ride, get some practice, and get your fitness in another dimension.",113
"If you don't sell or ship your bike to me, I guarantee you won't be able to find it.",84
"The idea of a carbon suspension fork is the perfect solution for the industry, but with an e-bike frame, you want to make sure you have enough suspension for the frame and the frame is lightweight enough so it doesn't break.",224
"In general, I would say the more your riding, the less you have to worry about being in a car accident. Take your time, and you'll eventually find your way out of the car.",171
we're all gonna die.,20
"For a company like ours, we’re not gonna let poor people into the cycling industry.",83
I ride a 2015 dh bike with a 2 year old 2018 i9 27.3 with 6.2 tires and a Super Decoy Rock Shox Ripmo and I love it. Really good trail bike.,140
Shimano used to have a bike park in the Canfield area of the UK called the Great Canfield.,90
"Bike marketing is a perfectly reasonable activity. We're all on the same page here. It's not about riders, but about the industry.",130
"Bike marketing is a bunch of asshats.  I've had enough of the crappy marketing from previous years.  After all, I've been riding for twenty-five years.  My first bike was my first bike that was really good.",206
"Being a world cup talent, I think it would be pretty cool to see a new rider with the same style and style as me having 2 titanium wheels.",138
"I can ride for about 10 hours a day and I'm sure I'm not as ""stiff"" as I'd like to be, but I'm not going to let my body stop me from riding.",140
The most important part of this is to have a good time. I have been doing this for years and it's a fun hobby.,110
"The most important thing is: your lungs work like a pump. Even if you don't believe it, if you do feel it, you'll feel it. You know you're pumping the body's pump. You know you're pumping the pump. The pump is the pump. It's your body's pump. It's your pump.",258
I like the fact that the second part of the fork is slightly down-slope when you're pedaling up and the first part is up-slope when you're pedaling down. It's a very nice bit of geometry.,187
"Why is this bike so damn expensive? We can't tell you because not everyone can ride it! If you just can't afford it, you better buy a frame that has more wheels than you need to. Why? Because you can't afford it!",212
Why not have a cool bike and tell people to keep it real?,57
"It's not like pinkbike is a gooch. They are a bunch of weirdos who feel the need to make money off of their crappy bikes, forcing other people to buy them for what they are worth.",179
@freesty10: I would hope you would not be so harsh on the people of the state of Florida. I also hope that you understand that you are the son of a Cocoa cave man and that it is not your fault that people are flooding our local trails.,235
"When I was a kid, I was told by my parents that I had to be free to ride bikes.",79
"I'd love to see more pinkbike articles. I seem to have a hard time finding stuff that covers different topics, but all the questions are about what's going on in the world, and they are not about race results.",209
"Have you guys heard of the the new Capra, the first one to be developed into a full face F-70?",94
"Those were big hits. I’d say the best part of this video is the music that Paul is wearing, and he is just pulling off those jumps and jumps. Stuff like that makes me want to shred.",181
The MTB industry is more dangerous than the military.,53
"""You're not interested in me in the slightest. I'm interested in you. I want you to know you're not alone."" @natekidd: I'm more of a sandy guy than you are.",156
"I think it's time to stop blaming bikers for the problems. The problem is the bikers are the ones who are making life miserable for themselves. Bike commuting is getting downvoted, and the entire world needs to call them out.",225
I’ve been riding in Peru for about a year and have actually found that I’m a bit of a f*cking douche.,101
"PB commenters, please repost the video with all the edits, all the extra water, all the extra dust and all the dust, just for the hell of it.P",142
"I'm not trying to be negative, but being an angry person is the most important thing for me.",92
"If you're going to be a slayer, you might as well go to the best mtb website out there.",87
"It’s not about frame size, it’s about girth.",44
"I thought a new bike was called the Grim Donut, and I'm guessing it was never really made. I'd like to see an actual review of the Donut to see if there are any flaws with it. I also like the fact that the geometry has some really good features.",245
"@mikelevy: Yeah it's not a bike park, it's a dirt road with a few trail features, a few trails to ride, some trails to ride and a few trails to ride and there's some trail building and generally a lot of technical trails to ride.",229
"If you can't do it on a bike, you can't do it on a bike.",56
"Bro, I'm going to call the cops and get you fired.",50
I thought we were going to see the Grim Donut. I'm going to assume that's likely a joke. We'll see if the Grim Donut gets a snooty finish.,138
Yep. I've had a few crashes with my head but never had an issue with anything.,78
The free-fall rate was the main reason I got into mountain biking. But it wasn't the only reason.,97
Send your bike to the dentist for a checkup.,44
If you have a lot of stamina (not just a minimum of 5 hours of that) you can sprint. There’s a whole lot of truth to that.,122
I have a 7.5 speed drivetrain in the box and I can fit the 11spd cassette to it.,80
I am one of the few who does not hate pinkbike. I stay home from work and am not trying to be a dick about it. I like to think they are the same as everyone else.,162
"I think the more people that ride the trails the better they're going to be, but I've learned for the last 10 years that: 1. You don't have to be a huge fan of a trail to enjoy it. 2. It's a trail that's designed for you. 3. It's a trail that you can ride.",256
"No wheels, no brakes, no tire pressure, no wind, no dampers, no hand brakes, no hand brakes, no gears, no brakes, no gears, no brakes. Good times, good times.",158
"No offense, but bikes are a bunch of little things, and not a big deal to me.",77
"The best way to race an XC race? No problem, no problem, just ride.",67
