I’ve been riding my used 2017 trail bike since summer and it’s barely functional. It’s built to last.,101
The whole world is watching you and some of you guys are being some shits and need to shut the fuck up.,103
"Regarding the nuts and bolts for the shock, they are all pretty simple. You can get a dropper for it in a few places, but you need to remember to put a battery in it.",166
Your riding is so much better than yours.,41
"@Muckal: Voted for you. I absolutely loved your work, but feel like I should have voted for you too. These days I'm like: """"Where's my vote?"""" You know how it is.",162
"@mikelevy: It's a shame because the Horizons Haster is a pretty cool bike for the price, but when it came out I was in for the shock fork. I had a set of Horizons forks on a few different bikes and was disappointed.",215
"No one is making a difference to the way bikes are ridden, except for people who need to be reminded that a bike is a bike.",123
I have a few comments about sick bikes. The clever folks at Offering have a great product. I'm in the market for a new bike. A new bike that sounds like it could be a sick one.,176
"If you want to be a good mechanic, you need to have a business. At best you can keep your business, and at worst you can't.",123
"In most cases, the more expensive the bike the more likely it is to fail.",73
"I have a suggestion for you: To get rid of the expensive, well-known, and on-line components of MTB, you can replace the bar, grips, grips and grips with a much more modern, modern, reliable spec.",196
"@brianpark: I know the guys at Pinkbike aren't in charge of your site / product/etc, but it sure seems like they're trying to get users to buy a product that isn't a """"websites"""" or """"a bulletin board"""" lol",206
"I'm a big fan of the freestylers, but I always have to wonder how the extra length of the trail is going to fit on the bike.",124
"I hate the fact the whole bike is like a second hand pile of garbage, it's the World Cup bike that was designed to be garbage.",126
I love the concept of an XC bike. I'm a tall and lean guy with a muscular build as well as a long legs. I'm not a big guy. I like to do it the way it's done. There are a few specific things I'd like to try though.,213
"I have a question for you. In other words, where the hell is the enduro season?",79
"""I hate the stink of a burrito!"" @rrolly: I'm not talking about the burrito. I'm talking about the fork.",104
I hate what I see.  Can't stand the concept of a 30 pound bike with a motor.,76
"I have the new GX, GX2, GX3, GX4, GX5, and GX6. Bike reviews are a lot more relevant now.",89
You're a redneck.  You have a shitty job.  You have a shitty family.  You have a shitty job.  You have a shitty job.  You have a shitty family.  You have a shitty job.  You have a shitty job.  You have,201
I hate the fact that you are riding an enduro bike that has just a single pivot and no chainstays.,98
"Comparing Fox and RockShox, I'd say the only real difference is that RockShox has a higher end graphics card.",109
"The best bike at $160 is a GoPro. I'm only slightly disappointed in the Rocky Mountain of the Ibis lineup. I have to admit, the Garmin is a great value; both the Garmin and the Garmin-XT are sky high.",200
"Looks like a hardtail. I think a lot of people are into the concept of a 200+ lb super light, but I'm not sure there are many people who are that into the idea of a frame with a 150-150 mm suspension and a 130-140 mm fork.",222
The only way to do better in a race is to run some speed wheels on your back.,77
I have a set of GX pedals that I cant find anywhere.,52
I am not going to bash the high altitude jumpers flat but there's no reason to be irresponsible and go out of your way to test ride trails.,139
I am embarrassed to say I am a little crazy. I had the same experience with myself having a few drinks at the trailhead. ,121
"I like the way he has this mental element to him. He is a true trail builder, he's got the attitude and the humility, the confidence and the determination to be the best. I'd say he's a good genetic kid, he loves the sport and loves the sport. ",244
I’ve been riding for over 100 years and still have my first MTB.,64
"When jumping, be sure to hold the top of the tube and let the air flow in, and ALSO the top tube should be in contact with the ground.",134
"I've raced a lot of the lower end trails and had a few crashes in the past that I'd like to share with you. I'm sure I'd like to run a bike a bit better, but I'm not sure that's worth the extra time.",199
"I've raced a lot of XC events and have won about twice as many XC events as any other rider. And yes, that's a good way to get some sleep.",138
"Haha, I’ve been following the trend for a while and now I've been buying more stuff. And I’m still pretty bummed about buying expensive stuff, because I’ve been buying more stuff for the last few years. It’s just like when I started, but it’s more expensive.",258
I am a 2/3 year old that likes rides. I have a 2.5 year old “Stumpy” and it’s such a fun ride. It’s such a lot of fun to ride and just a little bit more fun to ride. I can ride around town and ride trails and go to the gym.,223
"""As a California native, I think all California people should be able to get a beer and a pizza."" ""@jlawysports: I'm not sure about the pizza, but I do agree with your comment.",176
"The best bike for the money is a modern, modern, modern, modern, modern bike. I have a 50 year old DHR out of the box. It has been perfect all my life.",151
"I'm sure there are plenty of riders who can appear on the homepage and tell me I'm a stupid f*cking idiot for having the wrong idea. I'm not arguing that they should make the bike and make it a hardtail, just that they should make it a hardtail.",245
The best bike for the job is the one that makes you feel good about yourself. Good luck and keep climbing.,106
I only ride and ride. I don't want to be a dick about it.,57
"Oil slick. I think it's a good idea, but I'm not convinced it's worth it for the price.",87
The biggest mistake with bikes is that it doesn't even matter what the bike is. It's all about the riding. Riding it is the one thing you don't want.,149
Danny Macaskill was on the podium in a few seconds. I'll say more clearly: the slight heave-hooing that made that podium sound like a top-notch performance. He will be back in 2017. ,182
"""Danny Macaskill is a pro, but he is a guy who is more like the guy in the video, but he is also a pro pro. I'm sure there will be discussion on this, as well."" @pigman: I am not sure what the hell you're talking about.",219
"Bikes and politics. One side has the military, the other side has the fat rich.",79
"It’s funny, I’d rather buy a new bike while I still have a good pair of shoes. I’ll be buying shoes while I’m old.",114
Smashy is a great bike. But he’s a bit of a dick in a bunch of ways. I’m sure he’s not the same person. But that’s not the point.,129
"flat pedals are so much fun when you're on a hardtail but not when you're on a dh bike. I'm not a racer so I'm not sure. To begin with, I think it's good to have the ability to choose the pedals you'd like and then have a couple of weeks to plan your ride.",256
"Shit, I got in a fight with my training, I ended up doing really, really bad training, and got a full suspension bike in the same year. It was a pretty stupid bike.",164
Pinkbike commenters will still be angry if you don't show up on Pinkbike to call me a f*cking idiot.,100
"Pinkbike commenters, please stop calling me a douche.",53
"Pinkbike commenters will be shuttling me to every set of trails I ride. I'm not like the trolls, I'm not like the pot-heads, I'm like the drunk-ass social media types.",167
"Pinkbike commenters like to point out that PB is on the same team as the real estate companies who are in charge of the land. So, for example, the PB staff is on board with you that Google can show up your site with the title as Homeownership",242
I'm like a flaming ass for not buying a bike.,45
"Pinkbike commenters, can you guys let me know that you're going to be there for a few days? I'm sure you can figure out a way to get off my lawn.",145
"Pinkbike commenters, those stinking shells, those slow hands, those hands... I really don't get it. I saw a few videos of the Crankbrothers last year in the PNW, and I love how they're all still alive.",201
"I'm not a big fan of the idea of bigger bikes, but I'm not going to pretend that I'm a big fan of the idea of smaller bikes.",124
I was at the bike park and I'm still wearing a full suspension race bike.,73
Friday fails videos: It would be nice if all the riders were strong enough to hit the epic gaps,95
"It's important to note that I'm not a professional cyclist, but you can help me figure out whether I'm a professional cyclist, so here's my answer: yes.  It's not hard.",168
"I remember when I was in high school, all the bikes were so damn expensive that I had to make do with my own money. I ended up building a bike shop",147
The PB community is not at all prepared for this. I will be a PB Commentator for a little while until the time I am really ready to take over the world and start to approve comments.,182
"PB commenters are supposedly racist. I'm not sure if it's just me, but I have no idea. I wish they would make some diversity in the comments, but I don't think it's going to happen.",181
"Levy's fastest time in 2020 was 2.4 seconds, so I think it is safe to say that he is the fastest man in the world. I feel that he too has a lot of talent, but he is a lot slower than most of us.",194
Levy's list says he's done a lot of trash work in the past and that maybe he can be a good example for future generations.,122
"The bike looks great, will be nice to have two wheels. I'd be interested in buying one.",87
"Kaz: his real name is Sam Kazimer, and he is the first person to confirm that. He is a guy who's been with the same company for over a decade now, and he's all over the place.",175
The most annoying thing about Internet is that you have no idea what kind of stuff you are talking about.,105
The most annoying part of upgrading to a new bike is that you have to replace the frame every time you go to the shop for a frame replacement.,142
The most annoying part is that you have to take the pedal arse off the pedal.,77
"Crashing a bike into a rock garden is dangerous. I like seeing my bike bounce a bit off the rock, but it's never going to be like that.",135
Crashing is a great way to build confidence and a good way to build confidence and confidence as you race. I beat myself up trying to do this last year,151
"Crashing with your hands or feet is stupid. Period. If you can't handle it, it's probably because you're concerned for your own well-being. This is a very similar situation as when you have a broken collar bone and you're worried for your own well-being.",254
"Hardtails are the most expensive bikes ever built, the last one would've been $200,000. The other bikes are all over the place and they are all pretty much the same price.",171
I've been riding around in the woods with a friend a few weeks now and he's had a couple of crashes (presumably as a result of the wheel being on the ground),157
I'm not complaining about the trails. I'm complaining about the people who ride them. I'm trying to find out how they're able to go so far.,139
"I would have preferred a third wheel with a 5.8"" diameter. I am 3’4” and have smaller wheels, so the sizing is fine for me.",123
If I was riding in Canada I would be wearing a beard.,53
I'm pretty sure the guys on the roadie trail don't need to be in a competition.,79
The best way to learn is to win your first race. You'll get into ride mode a lot faster.,88
"The worst thing is that the frame is a shitty-built. I'm not ripping anything, but I'm seeing so many other people's frames and bikes with shitty frames with terrible little and tiny pieces of a frame that are just horrible.",224
Pinkbike is one of my fav bikes and it is also one of the most fun bikes I own. I also ride a lot of trails and have a lot of fun with my 3-5 year old XC bike.,159
inkbike has too many people and so many products to pick. They are nothing like a bike shop.,92
@mikelevy: I've got a bike for $10.,35
"Pinkbike commenters are so trash in their comments, that I don't even understand what they are saying.",102
"It's a great feeling to be able to go out and ride, get some practice, and get your fitness in another dimension.",113
"If you don't sell or ship your bike to me, I guarantee you won't be able to find it.",84
"The idea of a carbon suspension fork is the perfect solution for the industry, but with an e-bike frame, you want to make sure you have enough suspension for the frame and the frame is lightweight enough so it doesn't break.",224
"In general, I would say the more your riding, the less you have to worry about being in a car accident. Take your time, and you'll eventually find your way out of the car.",171
we're all gonna die.,20
"For a company like ours, we’re not gonna let poor people into the cycling industry.",83
I ride a 2015 dh bike with a 2 year old 2018 i9 27.3 with 6.2 tires and a Super Decoy Rock Shox Ripmo and I love it. Really good trail bike.,140
Shimano used to have a bike park in the Canfield area of the UK called the Great Canfield.,90
"Bike marketing is a perfectly reasonable activity. We're all on the same page here. It's not about riders, but about the industry.",130
"Bike marketing is a bunch of asshats.  I've had enough of the crappy marketing from previous years.  After all, I've been riding for twenty-five years.  My first bike was my first bike that was really good.",206
"Being a world cup talent, I think it would be pretty cool to see a new rider with the same style and style as me having 2 titanium wheels.",138
"I can ride for about 10 hours a day and I'm sure I'm not as ""stiff"" as I'd like to be, but I'm not going to let my body stop me from riding.",140
The most important part of this is to have a good time. I have been doing this for years and it's a fun hobby.,110
"The most important thing is: your lungs work like a pump. Even if you don't believe it, if you do feel it, you'll feel it. You know you're pumping the body's pump. You know you're pumping the pump. The pump is the pump. It's your body's pump. It's your pump.",258
I like the fact that the second part of the fork is slightly down-slope when you're pedaling up and the first part is up-slope when you're pedaling down. It's a very nice bit of geometry.,187
"Why is this bike so damn expensive? We can't tell you because not everyone can ride it! If you just can't afford it, you better buy a frame that has more wheels than you need to. Why? Because you can't afford it!",212
Why not have a cool bike and tell people to keep it real?,57
"It's not like pinkbike is a gooch. They are a bunch of weirdos who feel the need to make money off of their crappy bikes, forcing other people to buy them for what they are worth.",179
@freesty10: I would hope you would not be so harsh on the people of the state of Florida. I also hope that you understand that you are the son of a Cocoa cave man and that it is not your fault that people are flooding our local trails.,235
"When I was a kid, I was told by my parents that I had to be free to ride bikes.",79
"I'd love to see more pinkbike articles. I seem to have a hard time finding stuff that covers different topics, but all the questions are about what's going on in the world, and they are not about race results.",209
"Have you guys heard of the the new Capra, the first one to be developed into a full face F-70?",94
"Those were big hits. I’d say the best part of this video is the music that Paul is wearing, and he is just pulling off those jumps and jumps. Stuff like that makes me want to shred.",181
The MTB industry is more dangerous than the military.,53
"""You're not interested in me in the slightest. I'm interested in you. I want you to know you're not alone."" @natekidd: I'm more of a sandy guy than you are.",156
"I think it's time to stop blaming bikers for the problems. The problem is the bikers are the ones who are making life miserable for themselves. Bike commuting is getting downvoted, and the entire world needs to call them out.",225
I’ve been riding in Peru for about a year and have actually found that I’m a bit of a f*cking douche.,101
"PB commenters, please repost the video with all the edits, all the extra water, all the extra dust and all the dust, just for the hell of it.P",142
"I'm not trying to be negative, but being an angry person is the most important thing for me.",92
"If you're going to be a slayer, you might as well go to the best mtb website out there.",87
"It’s not about frame size, it’s about girth.",44
"I thought a new bike was called the Grim Donut, and I'm guessing it was never really made. I'd like to see an actual review of the Donut to see if there are any flaws with it. I also like the fact that the geometry has some really good features.",245
"@mikelevy: Yeah it's not a bike park, it's a dirt road with a few trail features, a few trails to ride, some trails to ride and a few trails to ride and there's some trail building and generally a lot of technical trails to ride.",229
"If you can't do it on a bike, you can't do it on a bike.",56
"Bro, I'm going to call the cops and get you fired.",50
I thought we were going to see the Grim Donut. I'm going to assume that's likely a joke. We'll see if the Grim Donut gets a snooty finish.,138
Yep. I've had a few crashes with my head but never had an issue with anything.,78
The free-fall rate was the main reason I got into mountain biking. But it wasn't the only reason.,97
Send your bike to the dentist for a checkup.,44
If you have a lot of stamina (not just a minimum of 5 hours of that) you can sprint. There’s a whole lot of truth to that.,122
I have a 7.5 speed drivetrain in the box and I can fit the 11spd cassette to it.,80
I am one of the few who does not hate pinkbike. I stay home from work and am not trying to be a dick about it. I like to think they are the same as everyone else.,162
"I think the more people that ride the trails the better they're going to be, but I've learned for the last 10 years that: 1. You don't have to be a huge fan of a trail to enjoy it. 2. It's a trail that's designed for you. 3. It's a trail that you can ride.",256
"No wheels, no brakes, no tire pressure, no wind, no dampers, no hand brakes, no hand brakes, no gears, no brakes, no gears, no brakes. Good times, good times.",158
"No offense, but bikes are a bunch of little things, and not a big deal to me.",77
"The best way to race an XC race? No problem, no problem, just ride.",67
The second I put a few pins in I could see the chainline on the chainring feathering and it was even more of a mess. One of the best looking chainrings I have ever seen.,169
I remember when I was young and I couldn't even afford a foot-mounted headset.,78
So you're who thinks you're better than everyone else. It's a great thing.,74
The best part was that I was riding my bike and all hell broke loose.,69
I think everyone needs to stop being such a dickhead and look at ways to improve their riding skills.,101
"I was raised in the same town as you and your father, he was a dentist and nurse, he also owned a truck repair shop, he bought a horse for a friend, he sold his workhorse, he retired from the military a few years ago and got a job with the local bike shop.",256
"The new high-end 2020 model is a complete shitshow with an e-bikes fork on the front and a set of tires on the back. It is beyond full-on mountain biking gear, and I hate spending money for it.",193
Don't get hung up on all the people who buy bikes and don't even know what they are doing.,90
The world isn't just a hellhole. It's a hellhole. The world is full of shit. You have to live in it.,100
"My wife is a professional mountain biker. She is the only female person I know. I am too, but she is the one with a PhD in biology. She had no problem separating the external and internal parts of her brain.",207
As an American you just don't need to worry about the chainstay.,64
"I remember when the Grim Donut was told to go to the toilet. I was in college and I was terrified of a Grim Donut. I didn't know it was a joke, but it was a beast and it was a scary thing to look at.",199
Still don't like this? I'm a total d*ck and this is the worst. I'm a huge fan of the bike and it's awesome.,107
"The world is so full of stuff to do, we need to get rid of it.",62
20mm fork that will be perfect for XC shoes.,44
What are you talking about? Your brain is a bunch of bullshit. There is no good way to say it.,94
What's the deal with the giant pink bike? The big pink bike has an g-spot? Is this a killer feature?,100
You've a flawed and false notion that the meta frame is just a specialized frame for the sake of its frame. I have a frame with a generic top tube and the meta frame is a frame with a full sag.,193
I just got my Commencal XC bike. I am a top end rider and I have been in the top end for over a decade now.,107
I would never use a 140mm fork if it didn't have a removable top tube (not that I disagree with that as long as you're on a road bike).,135
@mikekazimer: You're the only one with a problem with the Nexus 5. You will eventually have the same problems with the Nexus 6.,127
"My wife and I are on our second summer hike, this time lined with climbing, on the steep side of steep in the east. She and I are on a long long day hike down the hill.",168
"I'm not a fan of the new bike, but I will agree, the new bike is fantastic.",75
This guy is so dumb I thought he was a dentist.,47
I’ve used this as a trainer for my daughter. She is 6 months old and is on a bike trainer. She loves it and is constantly on the bike.,134
"I would like to see a longer dropper post, maybe a bit longer reach and a few big stem pins either 4 or 5 at the back.",118
I'd be interested to see MTBR standings. The most reliable WC lines in the world. Gwin wins by 10 strokes a time.,113
"I was easily a top 20 rider, and I would ride any bike I wanted.",64
My wife and I have been going through this same thing. We had a crash in the garage. No one was injured.,104
@brianpark: Thanks. I was just thinking about this as well. I've got a pair of flip flops and I love them. I’ve been riding them for about six years.,149
You have a big ego that needs to be thoroughly scrutinized.,59
Someone should get out and put an end to the Nukeproof.,55
"I've been using a long, steeper, coil, coil, coil, coil, coil, coil and coil with no problems. As long as you keep the compression constant you can really get the best out of the coil. This is what I'm trying to say.",216
"Just because I have a good, steady, positive attitude and have a low self-esteem doesn't mean I'm not going to engage in a lot of risky people's behaviors. I'm not going to ride my bike to make a living.",203
@brianpark: Go buy some bikes.,30
I think the reason that the techies are so f*cking angry with me is that I can see where they are coming from. It's not about the techies. It's about me. I just started to like this style of riding and the wide wheelbase and lack of sag.,237
I was just referring to it being a difference in the amount of energy your body exerts. It is like saying a person is stronger with a beer when he/she is in a bar. A guy who can make a difference in the gym or is stronger with a beer or three.,243
"$300 for the heck of it, but I'm going crazy for a $300 cassette to get it. I got the privateer in a month and you get a custom set up with a new set up vibe.",158
"If I could send a bazooka on any bike, I would. I wouldn't want to go out on the trails without it.",99
"I've got a Giro Yeti, which is one of the best bikes I have owned.",66
"Damn, I’m sick of seeing all the fricking new stuff on the daily. The last two years have been amazing. The new stuff is rad, but I’d buy a house to afford it.",159
@jeffa078: It’s pretty obvious you’re a conspiracy theorist. Haha. I have a bad case of OCD and I hate myself for an hour a day.,128
"I've got my pinkbike account and there's a guy called James Whalley at the top of a website called djb. The guy is really great. He starts to ride his bike from the top of the website and he says ""I'm going to take this one day.""",229
I’ll say this in a different way: it’s a bummer that we’re still seeing the comments section here.,98
"I have to say that I had a few friends who had similar experiences with the bike park. I had friends who were in the 'hoods of the park, and the bike park was so overbuilt that the trails were literally empty.",209
One of the reasons i started to ride is because i thought it was cool. So i started to ride and learnt how to ride. It's such a pain to ride and i live with that. But i are an amateur and can't just get into the sport.,218
You'd be a better rider if you lived in a different part of the world.,70
The new seatpost for the DHR6 is a great idea for the non-geo-yoga-yoga-yourname thingy. I'm a big fan of the DHR6.,115
The Pinkbike community on the east coast has been so supportive and I'm excited to be part of it. I'm a part of it because I'm tired of having to deal with the constant influx of freeriders who are constantly asking for rides to get money.,239
She's a great rider and a great rider. And I'm sure she runs a dyno too and can also run a kashima for a bike to be honest.,123
"I have a couple of plans for the future, but first, I'm gonna buy a new bike every year and keep them around for a while. Then I'll buy a pair of TLD's and a pair of TLD's on my next bike. I want to enjoy the trails I ride.",223
Just because I was born in the US doesn't mean that I can’t produce my own bikes.,81
"@WAKIdesigns: I know, I know, I know. I am not going to be the only one that states that you are wrong. But I do believe it’s wrong.",132
"I run a steep DH bike as a budget commuter, it's got great brakes and a good chainring and fork. I like that it's lighter and makes the bike more mobile when pedaling.",167
"In the past few years we've seen the release of """"tough guys"""" like Jeffsy, Gwin, etc. The only """"tough guys"""" that have gotten better in recent years have been the likes of Orbea, Sarah, and Crankworx.",202
"With my bike, I can't breathe. I try to hit it with my hip and occasionally my back. It's like riding a foreign land. I have a sore back and a sore back and back again. I don't want to pay for a new bike.",204
"You know, if you are on the right side of reality, the only thing that matters is what you believe.",99
This is an awesome set up. I absolutely love the feel of the stem on the bike. I had to remove it for a few days. Haha.,119
"The longer I ride the more I realize that this was my first MTB experience. I was as scared as all the others before me, and I can relate to that.",146
"I dunno, I don't need the new Cannondale, but I'm sure they will be sold for big money.",87
"I have watched this for the last several months and have no idea how many people have died from her injuries. She was just a great ambassador and a champion. Like I said, I don't know how many people have died.",210
What are we talking about? How did the earth change so drastically during the expansion of our human population? The arrival of the dinosaurs has given rise to the modern human population. The government is destroying the natural environment.,242
Ride more! - Ride more! - Ride more! - Ride more! - Ride more! - Ride more! - Ride more! - Ride more! - Ride more! - Ride more! - Ride more! - Ride more! - Ride more,165
"I'm a little disappointed that Tacos are not still available as a big part of the diet, it seems like a small company like Walmart or a small brand like Yeti is very much the same.",180
It's not about the cost. It's about the opportunity cost. I'll definitely be dropping $30k on a bike that's only $1k.,117
There are landmines to be had. I'm running one at the moment for trail building and maintenance and then an enduro bike for fitness.,132
The pinkbike community in general is a bunch of bullshit. They are people who are offended that pinkbike doesn't cover their comments.,134
"Pinkbike's press release announcing that YT has been acquired by Pinkbike for $2.8 billion. I mean, that’s $100 billion. I don’t know, it’s pretty crazy.",153
Are bike shops closing? No more stop signs.,43
@WAKIdesigns: You managed to get all of the comments over to the wrong place. You have to work your way up to the top. The best way to create a better comment is by posting it on PB.,182
"Because I'm a professional cyclist, I don't want to get pushed around by a bunch of dudes. These dudes are not professional cyclists and if they want to get pushed around, they have to ride slower. ",198
I’ve been on the same bike for 6 months now and it’s gone like a rock.,70
I don't see a good reason why I (and most people I know) wouldn't be better off with a different bike.,70
"@Maxwellrider76: I thought you were saying you were right. That's a lot of hate on a bike, but in the end, I'm on the same boat as you, and like you said, I'm a complete idiot. I'll never buy a bike.",199
Pinkbike commenters are having a hard time getting their heads out of their asses. In our modern times there are more and more people on the internet who think that bike companies are somehow out of touch with the tech community.,229
Pinkbike commenters come to me and say they know what they're talking about. The problem with that is there are absolutely few people on this site with the same experiences and knowledge that I have.,199
"Pinkbike commenters might be surprised to hear that the best riding is not on the trails, but on a bike park, or in a parking lot. The best riding is on your bike!",163
I'm not interested in making changes. I'm interested in making bikes better. I'm not interested in making bikes look better. I'm interested in making bikes feel better.,168
I am a mountain biker. I love to ride. I have a bike and a gear.,64
"You’re right, like it or not. I don’t think the new helmet should be a thing. I’ve had a few helmet replacements over the past few years and the ones that’re more comfortable are the ones that don’t have the stanchions.",219
I actually like the whole idea behind the new helmet and the helmet looks pretty good. I think it's an interesting concept. I'm going to think about it for years.,162
"I am not bashing you for being more sensitive to my opinions, but I still find it outrageous that you are calling for my removal from the sport, as I have no idea who you are or what you are trying to accomplish.",212
"I don't know what the best rider is, but I do know that they are faster. I think that is kinda the point of the sport.",118
"The trail is already a long, flat section, and I really like to be able to jump and roll around, but I also find it often very difficult to climb and reach the summit without pedaling.",184
"I'm not looking to sell the Sight to a super enduro bike company, but I like the simplicity of the rear triangle and the playful design. When I saw the Sight on the thrift stores I was hoping that the telescopic crown would have some sort of jibbing-like feel",259
"Ride your bikes as they do your ass off on the trails. The ability to rotate between bars, grips, grips and grips is one of the most important things to a rider.",161
"I've been very happy with my Norco Scout. I've seen it come to market in the US, but the US is still a bit of a wild country with a lot of trails.",146
"Pinkbike commenters arent here for bikes, but like to get some Grim Donut jokes.",80
You all think the same. Have you ever tried to get a Rift Zone to work with Whistler or Whistler? It's a nice little bike for those who prefer to ride in the mountains. Some people are just way over-biked.,205
The best part is when you head out to ride you don't have to look back.,71
@mikelevy: I really hate this thing called digital media. It's incompetent and it's ruining the economy.,104
"The best way to buy is to go to walmart and buy a ""standard"" bike.",66
I have a hard time holding my breath when I'm using the air suspension on a bike.,81
"Shit, I’d be interested to see some data to back that up.",57
"If you're gonna talk shit about a new bike, I'm gonna be your guy. ",67
"Ah you could definitely be wrong. My own personal opinion is that there is no such thing as a ""poop"" in the middle of a bikepacking trip because it is literally ""one of the best"" type of exercise.",196
"I had a couple of problems with my GX. First I was about to buy a GX, when I couldn't find a frame, the frame was totally gone. I ended up selling it back to the seller.",169
"I'm not the type to be accepting of others' opinions, but I'm the type to be willing to do whatever it takes.",109
"I have a more upright bike and a lot more climbing. I think the new 26’s are way better, and they are cheaper. I really like the new geo of the 26’s and riding them is easier.",175
"I went to the shop, and they had a service person on a phone call. They asked me if I wanted to borrow a cable clamp from them. I said yes, and the service was quick.",166
"I've been on the same bike for several years now and I have to say, this is the first time I've ever seen the bike be wrong about something.",140
"I have some proven, proven, proven brakes that I'm really happy with, but they are on a bike for a reason. I've installed them on my new bike and it is well within my reach. Anyone else have any examples of what you've found working well?",238
I ride my bike on my road bike. I ride it on my XC bike. I do an occasional jump over sharp trails.,99
"hahaha, it's stupid to suggest that a bike with a weird aspect ratio is somehow better than a bike with a way too narrow aspect ratio.",134
"I ended up switching to a 160 with a much bigger rear end and a bit more suspension tech. I'm not a big fan of the idea of a bike with a dropper post, so it made sense to move the rear end to the middle of the trail to get some movement out of the weight.",255
